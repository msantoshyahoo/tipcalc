## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I tried to use a picker control in the Settings view, but could not figure out how to initialize it statically. So used the Segment control
- I could not get the navigation back to the main view on click on Save button in the Settings view
- I disabled the AutoLayout, but if I tried simulation using 5s, the view is too big for that. 6/6s seemed better. Where is this specified by default? 
- I spent a lot of time building this other ToDoList app https://github.com/msantoshyahoo/ToDoList. So could not dedicate much towards improving this TipCalculator app.
